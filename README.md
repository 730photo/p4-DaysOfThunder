# Project 4- Days Of Thunder<br>

For project 4, I created a simple app that was similar to project Vagabond, the only difference is the content & the external API(which I couldn't figure out how to implement).

-When a user navigates to the landing page, he/she will be greeted 3 cards of NBA players (Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, & James Harden)

-Once the user clicks on one of the cards they are taken to that specific player page where there is a photo of the player that they want to make a post about.

-When the user clicks the ‘Add New Post button’, a form will pop up where they can add the Body of the post, and below the form is a ‘Submit’ button. Once the user clicks the ‘Submit’ button the post is then created.

-When a user clicks on their post they will be taken to the ‘posts’ page. On the ‘posts’ page they’ll be able to edit or delete the post that they clicked on. The ‘Edit’ and ‘Delete’ buttons are below the post.

-When the user clicks the ‘Edit’ button a blank form will appear where they can edit the post.
When the user clicks the ‘Delete’ button a modal box will appear saying, “Are You Sure You Want To Delete?”. And if you click the red ‘OK’ button, a modal box will appear letting you know that the deletion was a success.
